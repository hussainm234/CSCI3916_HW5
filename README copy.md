postman tests folder location : [postman/](postman/)

render link: https://csci3916-hw5-572h.onrender.com

The Extra credit google analytics report has been added as a pdf [Extra credit event report](Event_report_GA.pdf)

## Project

This project is a Node.js / Express REST API that builds on the previous assignments to manage a `movies` collection and a separate `reviews` collection in MongoDB. Reviews are stored independently and can be optionally included in movie responses using the query parameter `?reviews=true`. The API supports listing movies, retrieving a single movie (optionally with reviews), creating reviews (JWT-protected), and basic analytics hooks (extra credit) to report which movies are requested.

## Features

- Movies stored in a MongoDB collection
- Reviews stored in a separate MongoDB collection and linked by `movieId`
- Optional aggregated responses using MongoDB `$lookup` or Async.js
- JWT-protected POST for creating reviews (username from token recorded)
- Postman test collection included (paste your embed link below)
